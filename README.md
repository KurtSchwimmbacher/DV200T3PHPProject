## Development Process

### Highlights
* Highlights of the website is the stylised UI and the functionality that gives the user a pleasant user experience.
* The website is easy to understand and navigate.


### Challenges
* The integration of votes, comments and answers on posts was challenging to implement in a cohesive and intuitive way.
* Building in redundancy to the functionality of the website to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Future Implementations

* Allow Users to view other user Profiles
* Add super admin functionality that allows Admins to post announcements to the home page
* Allow users to create new tags or subcommunites for more specific questions
